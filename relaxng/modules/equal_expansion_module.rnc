# This module declares the following RuleML elements and attributes:
#            * <Equal>
#            * <left>
#            * <right>
#             leftTerm.choice
#             rightTerm.choice

## an extension point for alternate spellings and internationalization of the equation tag name.  
Equal-node.choice |= Equal.Node.def

## An equational formula consisting of two expressions, each of which contains an argument and may be optionally surrounded 
## by a left (<left>) or a right (<right>) role.

## The children of the equation element are divided into two sections, a header section for modifiers, and a main section for the formulas on either side of the equation. 
Equal.Node.def =
  
  ## <Equal>: an equation between two terms. See 
  ## http://www.ruleml.org/1.0/glossary/#gloss-Equal
  element Equal {
    (Equal-datt.choice & reEqual.attlist),
    Equal.header,
    Equal.main
  }

## Equations accept the header pattern of fuzzifiable formulas.
Equal.header &= SimpleFormula.header?
# For the declaration of the simple formula header, see the atomic formula module (atom_backbone_module).

## Equations contain a pair of terms, a left-hand side and a right-hand side.
Equal.main |= leftSide-edge.choice, rightSide-edge.choice

## an extension point for stripe skipping as well as alternate spellings and internationalization of the left-hand side tag name in equations.  
leftSide-edge.choice |= left.edge.def
left.edge.def =
  
  ## <left>: The left-hand side of an equation. See 
  ## http://www.ruleml.org/1.0/glossary/#gloss-left
  element left { left.content }

## The left-hand side role in an equation is filled by a term.
left.content |= leftTerm.choice

## an extension point for stripe skipping as well as alternate spellings and internationalization of the right-hand side tag name in equations.  
rightSide-edge.choice |= right.edge.def
right.edge.def =
  
  ## <right>: The right-hand side of an equation. See 
  ## http://www.ruleml.org/1.0/glossary/#gloss-right
  element right { right.content }

## The right-hand side role in an equation is filled by a term.
right.content |= rightTerm.choice

## terms allowed in the left-hand side of an equation 
leftTerm.choice |= AnyTerm.choice

## terms allowed in the right-hand side of an equation 
rightTerm.choice |= AnyTerm.choice
