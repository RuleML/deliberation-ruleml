# This module declares the following RuleML elements, attributes and patterns:
#            * <arg>
#            * <Ind>
#            * @index
# This module also declares the following RuleML choice pattern:
#            AnyTerm.choice
#            SimpleConstantTerm.choice
#            SimpleKeyTerm.choice
#            CompoundTerm.choice
#            DataTerm.choice

## an extension point for stripe skipping as well as specializations of the positional argument tag name. 
positionalArgument-edge.choice |= arg.edge.def

## A role used for the positional arguments of a logical atom (<Atom>), i.e. any of the following: <Ind>, <Data>, <Var>, <Skolem> or <Reify> (also <Expr> and <Plex> in non-Datalog sublanguages).
arg.edge.def =
  
  ## <arg>: one argument of an atomic formula. See 
  ## http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.02/glossary/#gloss-arg
  element arg { arg.type.def }

## The attribute @index is required for the positional argument role (property).
arg.type.def = (arg-datt.choice & rearg.attlist), arg.content
arg-datt.choice |= index-attrib.choice
rearg.attlist &= commonInit.attlist?

##
index-attrib.choice |= index.attrib.def
index.attrib.def =
  
  ## A required attribute for specifying the position of a positional argument (<arg>) within a logical atom (<Atom>).
  ## See http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.02/glossary/#gloss-index
  attribute index { index.value }
index.value |= xsd:positiveInteger

## The content model of positional arguments for atomic formulas consists of any single term.
arg.content |= AnyTerm.choice

## Terms may be simple or compound.
## Simple terms are either constant or quantifiable (variable).
AnyTerm.choice |= SimpleConstantTerm.choice
AnyTerm.choice |= SimpleQuantifiableTerm.choice
# For the declaration of the quantifiable term pattern, see the quantification module (quantifier_module)

## Compound terms may be partially constant and partially quantifiable.
AnyTerm.choice |= CompoundTerm.choice

## Skolem constants are simple constant terms, but are not used in keys. 
SimpleConstantTerm.choice |= Skolem-node.choice
# For the declaration of skolem constants, see the skolem module (skolem_module).

## Reified RuleML tags are simple constant terms, but are not used in keys.
SimpleConstantTerm.choice |= Reify-node.choice
# For the declaration of reification terms, see the reification module (reify_module).

## All terms used in keys must be constants.
SimpleConstantTerm.choice |= SimpleKeyTerm.choice

## Individuals and literals (data) are simple, constant terms, and may be used in slot keys.
SimpleKeyTerm.choice |= Individual-node.choice | DataTerm.choice

## Data terms are literals, and may have simple or complex datatypes.
# For the declaration of data terms, see the dataterm modules (dataterm_any_expansion_module and dataterm_simple_expansion_module).
## Compound terms are built up from other terms.
## Compound terms include expressions.
CompoundTerm.choice |= Expression-node.choice
# For the declaration of expressions terms, see the expression module (expr_module).

## Compound terms include generalized lists, a special expression that returns 
## the object that is the list of the arguments.
CompoundTerm.choice |= Plex_Any-node.choice
# For the declaration of generalized list terms, see the generalized list module (plex_module).

## an extension point for specializations of the individual tag name. 
Individual-node.choice |= Ind.Node.def

## An individual constant, as in Predicate logic, which can also be considered to be a fixed argument like RDF resources.
Ind.Node.def =
  
  ## <Ind>: an individual constant. See 
  ## http://deliberation.ruleml.org/1.02/glossary/#gloss-Ind
  element Ind { Ind.type.def }
Ind.type.def = (Ind-datt.choice & reInd.attlist), Ind.value

## Individuals optionally accept the attribute patterns of resources, and objects with user-defined types.
reInd.attlist &= Resource.attlist?
reInd.attlist &= Type.attlist?
# For the declaration of the attribute list for resources, see the iri modules (uri_module).
# For the declaration of the attribute list for objects with user-defined types, see the type module (type_module). 

## The content model for individuals is the XSD datatype token.
Ind.value |= xsd:token
termsForAtoms.sequence |= termsForAtoms.nonemptysequence.choice?
termsForExpressions.sequence |= termsForExpressions.nonemptysequence.choice?
reInd.attlist &= commonNode.attlist?

##
commonInit.attlist &= xmlid.attlist?
