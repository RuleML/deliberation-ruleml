## In expressions, zero or more slots are allowed.

## The slot element accepts optional cardinality and  weight attributes.

## The slot content model consists of a key (first position) and a filler (second position).

## The key (first position) in a slot contains an interpreted term or data, which may be simple or compound.

# For the declaration of term patterns, see the term module (individual_extension_module).

## The filler (second position) in a slot contains any single term.
