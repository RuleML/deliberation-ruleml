#            * <Implies>

#            * <head>

## a convenience pattern that unifies implications and equivalences
## because equivalence is allowed wherever implication is allowed.

    ## An implication rule. It consists of a conclusion role (<head>) followed by a Premise role (<body>), or, equivalently (since roles constitute unordered elements), a Premise role followed by a conclusion role.
    ## Alternatively, the roles may be skipped, in which case the Premise comes first followed by the conclusion as suggested by the element name 'Implies' (since the if of a rule implies the 'then', not vice versa).
    ## See http://www.ruleml.org/1.0/glossary/#gloss-Implies
    ## The children of the implication element are divided into two sections, a header section for modifiers, and a main section for the premises and conclusion.

#Implies.attlist = direction-att.option & material-att.option & closure-att.choice?

## Implications accept the header pattern of general formulas.
Implies.header &= CompoundFormula.header?

# 
# Implies.main |= notAllowed is declared in the initialization module.
# This pattern must be over-ridden to allow the Implies element to be used.
# The pattern of the main content of an implication is serialization dependent,
# but it will contain exactly one body (if) and one head (then).
# For the declaration of the main content if implications, see the serialization modules (orderstrict_module or orderlax_module)
