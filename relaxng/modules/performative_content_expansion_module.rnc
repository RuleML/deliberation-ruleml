# This module declares the following RuleML elements and attribute:
#            * AssertRetractFormula.choice
#            * QueryFormula.choice

## Formulas allowed in assertions and retractions:
## Simple formulas are allowed in assertions and retractions in all sub-languages.
## Conjunctions and disjunctions are allowed in assertions and retractions in sub-languages that contain these components.
## Implications and universal quantifications is allowed in assertions and retractions for all quantified sub-languages.
## Strong and weak negation are allowed in assertions and retractions for all sub-languages that contain these components.
## Existential quantification is added to assertions and retractions for full first-order sub-languages.
