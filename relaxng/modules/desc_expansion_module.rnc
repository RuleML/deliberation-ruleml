# This module declares the following RuleML elements and attributes:
#            * <oid>

## an extension point for stripe skipping as well as alternate spellings and internationalization of the object identifier tag name.  
objectIdentifier-edge.choice |= oid.edge.def

## An optional label for a clause, creating accessibility within the knowledge representation. 
## This can help for representing prioritization between rules, for example. 
## All type tags (i.e. those that begin with an uppercase letter) of RuleML can begin with 
## such a label except those that permit only character data (e.g. <Ind>, <Rel>, etc.). 
## Note that oids are not required to be unique within a rulebase.
oid.edge.def =
  
  ## <oid>: a label for Node elements. See 
  ## http://www.ruleml.org/1.0/glossary/#gloss-oid
  element oid { oid.attlist? & oid.content }

## The object descriptor content model consists of any single term.
## Note: this corrects an error in the oid content model of RuleML 1.0,
## where Var is allowed in oid in bindatagroundlog and bindatagroundfact.
oid.content |= AnyTerm.choice
# For the declaration of the term patterns, see the term module (individual_expansion_module)
