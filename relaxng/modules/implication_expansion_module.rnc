# This module declares the following RuleML elements and attributes:
#            * <Implies>
#            * <if>
#            * <then>
# This module also declares the following RuleML choice pattern:
# PremiseFormula.choice
# ConclusionFormula.choice

## a convenience pattern that unifies implications and equivalences
## because equivalence is allowed wherever implication is allowed.

Implies-node.choice |= Implies.Node.def

## An implication rule. It consists of a conclusion role (<then>) followed by a Premise role (<if>), or, equivalently (since roles constitute unordered elements), a Premise role followed by a conclusion role.
## Alternatively, the roles may be skipped, in which case the Premise comes first followed by the conclusion as suggested by the element name 'Implies'.
## The children of the implication element are divided into two sections, a header section for modifiers, and a main section for the premises and conclusion.
